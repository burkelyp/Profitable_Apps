# Profitable_Apps
2nd guided project from DataQuest.io

For this project I was assuming to be working as a data scientist for a company that builds free Android and iOS mobile apps. Profit is entirely based on in-app ads which means we rely on high user count.

The majority of the project was data cleaning, but I then determined the most common and most popular apps by category, and was able to make a suggestion to the app developers as to what kind of app might be the most successful. 

Reference apps were the most popular genre after social media, navigation, and communication apps. Rather than go up against Google, Facebook, Instagram, and Waze, we determined a reference app would have the most potential. In particular, a religious or gaming reference app
